# The Engineer's Ingredients

Knowledge representations for future engineers.

## Help the engineers of the future!

This project gathers specifically crafted digital content focused on engineering, which collectively represents the vision of immediately accessible knowledge, digestible in a way that our brain can develop better connections between various concepts. By using animations, dynamism, real-time feedback, direct manipulation of data and interactivity, knowledge is intertwined with stories, parables and metaphors.
